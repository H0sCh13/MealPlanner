# MealPlanner
Very basic Meal Planner (Work in Progress)

The Project is based on a list directory and dictionary, which are both used to either visualize your changes to the actual Meal list but also display the Calories of each Meal.
The Randomize function then connects the current Meal list with corresponding Meals and displays them for one week.


Work in Progress:

IÂ´m still figuring out how to save the current file as a whole, so that changes also appeal to the original file.

A Description of each function of the program in detail also not implemented yet.
